# TailwindCSS practice
The purpose of this project is to learn Tailwind and apply it into a real website.

I made the layout in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/vkfxh6GrEU4njKtAOTo11x/Share-Calmly?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=5F7kelGJQc91qbgT-1), to get all colours, spacing, texts and elements right. Then I took the liberty to tweak it to reduce font-sizes and spaces to focus more on the utility classes rather than being 100% accurate.

For the development part, this project reinforced my skills with flex and grid, and I learned as well how to add SVG paths instead of SVG files to modify the colours and apply hover states.
Making a responsive navigation is one thing that I wanted to focus on, animating the hamburger menu and adding logic with JavaScript. I will continue learning that process in future projects.

I enjoyed using utility classes for this page, it was so much easier applying predefined classes and not think of class names for each element. There were a lot of bumps as usual since it was my first experience, but almost all my questions were solved.
